## Overview

Wormhole is a cross-chain messaging protocol that enables secure communication and asset transfers between Avalanche and other blockchain networks. It provides a generic message passing infrastructure that supports various use cases, from simple token transfers to complex cross-chain application logic, all secured by a decentralized guardian network.

## Features

- **Generic Messaging**: Send arbitrary messages between supported chains.
- **Token Bridge**: Native and wrapped token transfers across chains.
- **NFT Bridge**: Transfer NFTs between different blockchains.
- **Guardian Network**: Decentralized network of validators securing cross-chain messages.
- **Automated Relayers**: Efficient message delivery system.
- **xChain Query System**: Query data across different chains.
- **Developer SDK**: Comprehensive tools for cross-chain development.
